# TTS Script Guidelines

## Voice and Tone
- **Professional but friendly**: Sound like a helpful assistant, not a robot
- **Clear and concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Natural pacing**: Speak at a comfortable speed
- **Polite and respectful**: Always be courteous

## Script Structure
1. **Greeting**: Brief, friendly greeting
2. **Purpose**: Clear statement of why you're calling
3. **Key Information**: Essential details (time, location, title)
4. **Action Options**: Clear DTMF menu
5. **Closing**: Polite goodbye

## DTMF Menu Guidelines
- **1**: Confirm (positive action)
- **2**: Reschedule (neutral action)
- **3**: Cancel (negative action)
- **9**: Repeat message
- **0**: Send email with details

## Script Examples

### Standard Reminder
"Hello! This is your personal assistant calling about an upcoming appointment. You have a team meeting tomorrow at 2 PM in Conference Room A. Press 1 to confirm, 2 to reschedule, or 3 to cancel. Press 9 to repeat this message, or press 0 to have details sent to your email."

### Urgent Reminder
"Hello! This is an urgent reminder from your personal assistant. You have a client call starting in 15 minutes at 3 PM. Press 1 to confirm you're ready, 2 to reschedule, or 3 to cancel. Press 9 to repeat this message."

### Travel Reminder
"Hello! This is your personal assistant. You have a meeting tomorrow at 10 AM at the downtown office. Please allow extra time for travel. Press 1 to confirm, 2 to reschedule, or 3 to cancel."

## Best Practices
- **Keep under 30 seconds**: Respect the user's time
- **Use natural language**: Avoid robotic phrasing
- **Include time context**: "tomorrow at 2 PM" not just "2 PM"
- **Mention location if relevant**: Help with travel planning
- **Always provide options**: Give user control
- **Handle edge cases**: "If you're not available, press 0 for email details"

## What to Avoid
- **Long pauses**: Keep the flow natural
- **Complex instructions**: Simple, clear options only
- **Sensitive information**: Never mention personal details
- **Multiple topics**: One call, one purpose
- **Technical jargon**: Use everyday language
